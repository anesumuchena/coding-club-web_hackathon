Hackathon Problem Statement: "Build the Coding Club Website"

The Coding Club needs a dynamic and beginner-friendly website to serve as its official online hub. Your challenge is to design and develop a fully functional website that showcases the club, engages visitors, and provides essential information for both new and existing members an example of this would be Wits Developer Society https://lamp.ms.wits.ac.za/devsoc/.

The website should include:

• Homepage: A welcoming and engaging introduction to the club.
• About Section: Information about the club, its mission, activities, and executive team.
• Events Page: A section for upcoming events, workshops, and hackathons.
• Resources & Projects: Space to showcase member projects, coding resources,
or tutorials.
• Contact & Social Media Links: Direct links to WhatsApp, Instagram, LinkedIn, GitHub, and TikTok.

Technologies & Flexibility:

The website should be beginner-friendly, primarily using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but participants are free to explore other frameworks or technologies. Bonus points for creative UI/UX, responsiveness, and interactive elements that enhance the user experience.

Can you build the face of the Coding Club?
